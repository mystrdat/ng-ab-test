# NgAbTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Production build

I used Heroku as production server. Just push the code to Heroku GIT, `postinstall` script will take care of everything.

## Configuration

There's no server-side rendering, it's simple SPA app with server that serves static content. Also there are no configuration options for Google Analytics Tracking ID, it needs to be filled in `src/index.html` manually (sorry).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
